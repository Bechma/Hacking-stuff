# What are these programs?

- aircrack DoS: you want to leave your router on but don't want anyone to connect to it? Simple python script to work with aircrack
- chat: simple chat(maybe too simple), if you want to communicate with friends in your command line
- Tic tac toe: well, nothing more to say.
